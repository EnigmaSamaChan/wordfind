                 stroll down the path until he reached the pond. Although there didn't seem to be a particular reason Jerry did this to anyone looking in from the outside, those who knew him well knew 
                 exactly what was going on. It could all be traced back to a specific incident that happened exactly 5 years previously.</p>
